# Data Engineering Project 

## Overview 
This project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline and predictive model to estimate taxi tip amounts utilizing the TLC Yellow Taxi Trip datasets from 2022 and 2023. The workflow begins with data acquisition, automating the downloading of Parquet files from the TLC website and storing them in a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Next, exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the data and generate descriptive statistics of the variables. Extensive data cleaning was conducted to remove outliers and to ensure the dataset mostly comprised realistic taxi rides. The cleaned data was further processed during feature engineering in a PySpark environment. New temporal features were created to enhance the dataset for achieving better model evaluation scores. Categorical variables were indexed and one-hot encoded, while continuous variables were normalized. The prepared data was trained on a linear regression model, which was evaluated on metrics of RMSE and R-squared. The model achieved an RMSE of 2.18 and an R-squared of 0.63, indicating moderate performance. During hyperparameter tuning, grid search and cross-validation were applied to optimize results, though performance remained unchanged. According to the best model, the most important features were “hour_of_day,” which had a substantial positive impact on tip amounts, whereas “congestion_surcharge” had a negative influence. Several visualizations were produced, highlighting insights into prediction accuracy, residual patterns, feature importance, and temporal trends.
